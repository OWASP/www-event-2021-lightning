  subject: The Future of Security Cloud Native
  #abstract: "Crowdsourced security has created countless opportunities for hackers to forge new paths and establish new revenue streams. Beyond making money from hunting for bugs, this also includes creating hacker-specific services for both hackers and the enterprise, taking on AppSec or offensive security roles, becoming a content creator, pentesting, running or participating in learning platforms, and more. In this talk, we’ll delve into the different ways hackers can leverage their experience with bug bounties to create revenue streams that works best for them.
 #           We’ll hear from HackerOne’s Head of Hacker Education Ben Sadeghipour, better known by @nahamsec online, about his story and how he has made a career in bug bounty, content creation, and beyond by developing strategic opportunities based on learnings — and earnings — from crowdsourced security platforms."
